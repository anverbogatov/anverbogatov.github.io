## Disclaimer
Hi there!

If you are wondering, why-in-hell somebody uses plain html-css for web-site creation, then I must say that I am aware about existence of dozens of different tools on the market, and I do not use them cautiously.

I am a back-end engineer, and I want to use simple web technologies (instead of monstrous node.js, static generators or web site constructor services) for building my own place on the Internet.
