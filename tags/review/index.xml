Tomorrow will be my first day at work. I don't worry much, of course, because I've been going for this for a whole year. I found time for programming every day.
I studied something, wrote, a lot of things were not clear and a lot of things are still not clear üòÅ.
But I want to say thank you very much for everything. For what he wrote to me that day, he offered to help, it was very important for me, and that day I realized that this was a sign for me. (you can laugh about it, but it really was) üòÅ.
I was shocked about how you painted everything for me, everything was very competent and intelligible.
Thank you very much )
for explaining and chewing on my every question. It helped me a lot and motivated and supported me.
How many times have I started writing to you about my problem and how I just wanted to press the send button. üòÄThe answer immediately crossed my mind.
Plin thanks a lot the day you wrote to me, it was a defining moment for me)
And now tomorrow will be my first working day üôÇ
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;hr></content></item></channel></rss>
