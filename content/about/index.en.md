# Let's get acquainted

I am really happy to see you on my own small island in a huge ocean of Internet.

I have been software engineer for all of my professional life, and I have been developing different kind of applications using Java programming language:
* from small terminal utilities up to huge enterprise software
* from small and lightweight microservices up to gigantic monoliths

Some time I was even passionate about mobile development in which I have wrote a few applications on a freelance and a couple for myself for iOS & Android using Swift & Java. 

I have been doing software engineering for last 12 years and I feel like I finally want to pay my debt to the industry, which taught me everything and I want to help future generations to do a "Quick Start" in their own career.

You can find materials on following topics on my web site:
* software architecture and software design
* skills of modern developers aimed to quick growth
* specificity of different technologies

and many many more. All of these materials will help you to look wider onto career of software engineer.
