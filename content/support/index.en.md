Write articles in a notepad - is a hobby.

Write articles aimed to teach somebody - **it's a job**.

I do that because I want to be grateful to the IT community for who I have become.
I do that because when I was learning all the topics, I did not have a person who could explain things to me or who could answer my questions...
I do that in my spare time, instead of having fun or sometime even instead of hanging out with my family.

If my articles were useful for you, you can show your gratitude by clicking on the picture below. **Your gratitude motivates me write more.**
