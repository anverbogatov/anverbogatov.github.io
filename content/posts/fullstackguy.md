Today, I have found out that my new YouTube channel has finally reached it's first 100 views, and I have decided to write something about it.
In a life of a programmer thoughts about own business or side projects always revolve around. So, that happened to me either.
I was thinking about own side-projects for whole of my professional life. Previously, it was own Flappy Bird-like mobile game, then own 
reporting service with analytics and dashboards for Todoist service and many more. 

Last months, I was thinking about ways of sharing my knowledge with newbies in IT.

## What is FullStackGuy?
FullStackGuy is a community of people where newbies in IT can connect to experts in their interest area... That how it looked in my head.
But since I have zero idea of how to run a community, FullStackGuy is a small web-site and YouTube channel through which I, software engineer
with more than 12 years of experience can share my knowledge with others.

## How I came to the project?
There is a good proverb that is written almost in any business related book, and it looks like this:
"Find a problem that you have, try to solve it, and you definitely will be not a lone guy with that problem".

Back these days when I was only about to start my own career, I was in a situation when I had only books on programming, but not somebody that I can 
ask some questions about programming or IT in general. I had to learn new topics and themes by myself without having somebody to ask for help - that was a 
huge challenge for me. And I remembered that problem for whole of my life.

A year ago, I have remembered that part of my professional life and decided to try myself in a mentorship. I have found a student, 
we agreed on a process and during next 8 months we were working on the problems he faced. Last autumn I have received a word of gratitude from him.
He said that he had found his first job as a Java programmer, and I was really happy to hear that and really proud of him.

Now, when I try to search for a new student I see a lot of offers from programming tutors who ready to help for money. That is not bad, but because of them
each time I ask potential student about possibility to help him, he just do not believe that somebody can offer help for free. That is sad. 

That story happens to me not once and basically, that is the reason why I have decided to start FullStackGuy project where I can share my knowledge with 
the World for free.

## What is my personal impression on it?
Well... On the YouTube I have subscribed to many engineers who usually tell their stores about the industry, their projects, their lives, migration and so on.
They tell these stories so easy, and that is so interesting to listen to them.

And that can not be compared to the situation when you try to tell suchlike stories by yourself.üòÅ
As it turned out that is so hard to do speeches that are fascinating for people.

Second thing that I want to highlight is rich visual. YouTube is a platform for video, for the people who like great visual and can
digest information supported by rich visuals. So, screencast is a very good format, but I think it is not rich enough to represent ideas.
So, each time I record something I face with the trade-off - either I will do a simple screencast fast OR I will do something great from visual perspective, but
in a significant amount of time.

Anyway, these two observations are just my personal thoughts, and they can be far from the truth.

## Recap
Anyway, I think that attempt to explain ideas that you were aware for a long time ago, is the best exercise for a senior engineers because it 
can easily show how deep your knowledge are. I will definitely continue recording videos for FullStackGuy channel and will see how deep is the Rabbit Hole.
