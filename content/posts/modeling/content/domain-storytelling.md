## What is Domain Storytelling?
Is a modelling technique that helps you visualize business processes of any business domains.
It comprised of picto-graphic language and set of rules with which you can visualize core business processes and 
tell stories about your business domain.

## When it can be useful?
Domain Storytelling can be used in following cases:
* when you need discover your business domain. In that case, you need to have domain experts at your disposal. Modelling session should be contacted along with live discussion with domain expert who can tell you stories about business domain. Usually, that kind of work is performed in a format of workshop where domain expert tells stories about domain and modeller draws Domain Storytelling diagrams aligned with what domain expert said.
* when you need to share the knowledge about your business domain. Outcome of Domain Storytelling modelling sessions is always one or many diagrams that represent business processes. These diagrams are very easy to read and understand. That makes Domain Storytelling a perfect tool to do a knowledge transfer about domain. For example, you can document your domain with it with domain expert and then use these diagrams as an input for product development. 
* when you need to design software architecture. Domain Storytelling is more about business then software, but it can be also useful close to the software implementation. With Domain Storytelling diagrams you can easily spot separate bounded context in business process flow. That information can be used when you will do context mapping session (of course if you work with DDD)
* and finally - when you want to look onto the future. Domain Storytelling can be useful not only when you work with current state of the business, but it also can be useful to model how your software can change existing business processes in the future
