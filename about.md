I'm a software developer in Oakland, California. I'm primarily an iOS developer, though I have other programming interests. You can find my up-to-date résumé on [LinkedIn]({{ site.social_links.linkedin }}). My open source projects are on [GitHub]({{ site.social_links.github}}) and my iOS libraries are on [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/owners/1808). My side projects can be found at [Hexed Bits](https://hexedbits.com). I curate the [*Swift Weekly Brief*](https://swiftweekly.github.io) newsletter and co-host the [Swift Unwrapped](https://spec.fm/podcasts/swift-unwrapped) podcast.

I'm currently an iOS developer at [PlanGrid](https://plangrid.com). Previously, I've worked at [Instagram](https://instagram.com) and [Rosetta Stone](https://rosettastone.com).

My interests include software design patterns and architecture, cognitive science, moral philosophy, avant-garde art, and coffee. I enjoy barefoot trail running and body modification. When I'm not working or running, you can find me at punk and metal shows in the Bay Area.
