What is Visual Programming? So, visual programming is special approach where instead of writing code by your hands in a form of text written in specific syntax, you just drag & drop special boxes onto a form. In the end, your &ldquo;tower&rdquo; comprised of many boxes represent some algorithm that will be executed by some engine in runtime."><meta property="og:type" content="article"><meta property="og:url" content="/posts/scratch-in-2021/"><meta property="article:section" content="posts"><meta property="article:published_time" content="2021-12-05T15:52:23+04:00"><meta property="article:modified_time" content="2021-12-05T15:52:23+04:00"><meta name=description content="Scratch in 2021"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/9.18.1/styles/atom-one-dark.min.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/layouts/single.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/navigators/sidebar.css><link rel=stylesheet href=/css/style.css><script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-QX8WGB4JN0"></script>

you just drag & drop special boxes onto a form. In the end, your &ldquo;tower&rdquo; comprised of many boxes represent some algorithm that will
be executed by some engine in runtime.</p><p>The fun thing that the algorithm you can build that way is not an abstraction in vacuum. It attached to something in your project.
That is how you can program your games, for example.</p><p>You define your characters or playable objects and attach your algorithms to them. That is how things come to live in your project.</p><h2 id=what-is-scratch>What is Scratch?</h2><p>Scratch is a visual programming platform that includes own visual programming language, runtime and platform for sharing your
projects between other users of the platform.</p><p>It includes web editor with which you instantly can start making your own project. It also includes downloadable and installable
software. So, if you are Windows or macOS user you can install Scratch editor to your local device.</p><p>Just to give you a sneak peek of how a Scratch project can look like, here is a source code of one of our playable actors in &ldquo;Parrot Battle&rdquo; game - the game that we have built together with my kids:
<img src=/images/scratch-in-2021/1.png alt=parrot-battle-game></p><h2 id=story-behind-that>Story behind that</h2><p>Since I am a software developer for more than 12 years already, and I am a husband and a father of three beautiful kids my personal goal
is to foster good software engineer at least in one of my children.</p><p>So, some time ago we have attempted to visit local programming center for kids, but that did not last long because it was
too hard for my daughter to understand everything. That was not even a surprise, she was the youngest kid in her group.</p><p>As a next attempt, we have bought online course about programming made specifically for children. It was suggested for use along with primary school&rsquo;s subjects and
our school teacher strongly advised to use that educational platform for learning school subjects. So, we have decided to try programming course there as well. After about 80 exercises
it become too difficult for my daughter to compose own algorithms, and she discontinued the course. Later we gave the course to our son, and he achieved better results with the course,
but still - it was too boring to write own algorithms for kids.</p><p>Yesterday, I have watched some videos about game dev on YouTube and one interview stuck in my memory. There was a 10-year kid who said that
he was going to learn real programming language to make games after he had created and released 4-5 games on Scratch. I was confused - how is that possible?
10-year guy who already released multiple games.. He must have learnt programming years before the interview and that will match age of my kids.</p><p>So, I have decided to try once again and teach my children Scratch.</p><h2 id=how-was-it>How was it?</h2><p>It took roughly half an hour from me to setup everything and figure out how animated cartoons can be created using Scratch.
So, that was our start point. I have created a short scene where truck drives to the base to get small frog from there and get it home.
I have also added some funny sounds for main actors - the frog and the truck.</p><p>Then I have shown the animation to my children. They were laughing and liked that a lot, but after&mldr; Suddenly, they asked how they can do similar thing? And that
is how they got into it as well.</p><p><img src=/images/scratch-in-2021/2.jpg alt=young-game-developers></p><p>After two ours of making multiple small projects they got familiar with events, entry points, x & y and input concepts. Of course, they could use these
concepts not freely, but on the level enough to build first own game. That is how they have created own game called &ldquo;Parrot Battle&rdquo;.</p><p>Even taking into account that they have created own game with my help, I have become a proud father of my kids who designed and created short game - their very first software project
in their life. That is also my personal achievement - I have seen spark in their eyes, and we agreed to make such &ldquo;Sunday programming lessons&rdquo; every Sunday. Let&rsquo;s see how
far that will go, but I will struggle to grow their interest in that.</p><h2 id=recap>Recap</h2><p>As a recap, I want to say a few words about &ldquo;Scratch in 2021&rdquo;. I can not judge about it, because I am not in that area at all.
But - I can compare with other ways of learning programming for kids, and I am sure for 100% that Scratch is the best way to teach
your kids programming. 👍</p><h2 id=useful-materials>Useful materials</h2><ul><li>[1] <a href=https://scratch.mit.edu>Scratch platform</a></li><li>[2] <a href=https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/611836744>Parrot Battle</a>: The Game</li></ul></div><div class="row pl-3 pr-3"><div class="col-md-6 share-buttons"></div><div class="col-md-6 btn-improve-page"><a href=https://github.com/hugo-toha/hugo-toha.github.io/edit/main/content/posts/scratch-in-2021.md title="Improve this page" target=_blank rel=noopener><i class="fas fa-code-branch"></i>
