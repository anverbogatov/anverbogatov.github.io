You may have noticed that I did not write [the](http://swiftweekly.github.io/issue-38/) [last](http://swiftweekly.github.io/issue-39/) [few](http://swiftweekly.github.io/issue-40/) issues of the [*Swift Weekly Brief*](http://swiftweekly.github.io). I took some much needed time off, and I was able to unplug and relax thanks to the wonderful [JP Simard](https://twitter.com/simjp) and [Brian Gesiak](https://twitter.com/modocache). They took over for those weeks and I can't thank them enough! [Bas Broek](https://twitter.com/BasThomas) also made regular contributions, which was super helpful.

But JP and Brian didn't just help publish a few issues. They *brought their own perspective and style* and the results were amazing. They did an **outstanding** job. This is the vision I had for *Swift Weekly Brief* from the beginning &mdash; it's not my newsletter, it belongs to the community. This is why it's a [GitHub organization](https://github.com/SwiftWeekly) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), so *anyone* can contribute.

This is why I'm writing today &mdash; to invite you join us as a guest writer, if you're interested. [I'm back](http://swiftweekly.github.io/issue-41/) today for this week's issue., but [Bas Broek](https://twitter.com/BasThomas) will be writing [next week](https://github.com/SwiftWeekly/swiftweekly.github.io/issues/102).

If you would like to join us, [open an issue](https://github.com/SwiftWeekly/swiftweekly.github.io/issues/new)!
